Belvedere Home Services
is my first Razor-based project. Functionally, it works, but for it to be considered complete there are 
a few more things that must be done. Currently there's an issue where the database is not populating correctly, which stems from 
an issue I'm still solving where opening a migration to update the database generates 99% empty.

This project doesn't feature authentication or authorization, however my next project, and issue tracker, will. I started this project with intentions
of learning and refining the basics of Razor Pages, web development, and working with databases. Thanks for taking a look!
